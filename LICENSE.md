TBD, I want to consult my lawyers first. Especially given that this is a tool for scraping proprietary data. 

So for now, **don't use it for anything**...yet. But feel free to read and study the code for the art of it.

P.S. Laughing at how bad some of code is written is imho comedy, so technically still art too!
