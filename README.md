# EpicList

(coming soon to https://epiclist.tech )

## Description

EpicList aims to make AwesomeLists more Epic by adding a few features:

- [ ] **EpicList** is a **single** list of **all** the **awesome** lists
- [ ] **EpicList** is **automatically** updated **frequently** with the latest changes from the awesome lists
- [ ] **EpicList** creates a **personalized** news-feed of the latest and greatest you care about.
- [ ] **EpicList** can **search** and even semantically query for things like "What is an equivalent of lodash in Python?"
- [ ] **EpicList** provides a **badge** API to quickly create a summary of the most important metrics to compare projects with.

## Architecture

- Rust...duh
- Leptos
  - HTMX
- Neon (probably)
- Tailwind

## Why?

I love Rust and I didn't get enough time to work with it in my daily job. I'm also constantly stargazing through GitHub and Google News and got frustrated that I keep having to spit through the same lists over and over again. So I decided to combine the two and create a project that I can work on in my free time and have a place to experiment with cool looking libraries. I especially wanted to try and build the frontend in Rust as well as I'm a bit React/NextJS fatigued. They're great projects; I just don't derive happiness from them anymore.
